# Hello, I'm Javier üëã

## About Me

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for coding and technology. My journey began in 2020, and since then, I've been continuously learning and growing in the tech space.

üéì I will be graduating from the University of California, Merced in May 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, where I honed my skills in Python, C++, Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Database Systems.

üå± Currently, I'm focused on improving my expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning, and I'm always on the lookout for new and challenging projects.

üî≠ My latest project is LifeLine Aid, which is a mobile application that connects refugees with humanitarian aid. It was developed at [CalHacks 2023](<https://www.calhacks.io/>) and received 1st Place for Best use of CockroachDB. Check it out [here](<https://devpost.com/software/lifeline-aid>).

## Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Tools:** Git, MacOS/Windows/Linux, ArcGIS, MATLAB.
- **Databases:** SQLite, CockroachDB, Firebase.

## Projects

Here are some highlights from my portfolio:

### [Healthy UC](<https://devpost.com/software/healthy-uc>)
Boasting a comprehensive database of UC Merced's Pavilion and YWDC's menu, this app guarantees to revolutionize the way you select your meals. With just a few taps, you'll be presented with a personalized meal suggestion tailored to your specific requirements - whether it's dietary restrictions, BMI, or target goals. The app even offers alternative options and shows you the nearest location to grab your healthy meal. Say goodbye to lengthy decision-making processes and hello to a simplified, efficient, and healthy lifestyle with our iOS app.

- **Technologies Used:** React Native, SQLite, Flask, Python, pandas, Anaconda, Figma, Selenium, Node.js, Sqlalchemy
- **Outcome:** Our team was clever enough to bypass the engineers that created the UC Merced Dining website. We created an SQLite database containing all the food:calorie information and we were able to successfully scrape the UC Merced Pavilion / YWDC Website. Our team made a back-end server with flask with routing that could communicate with the front-end. I successfully developed an initial version of our mobile app's front-end using React-Native. Our project won 1st Place at HackMerced!

### [Heartbeat Classification Models](<https://github.com/jm2601/cardiac_challenge>)
This project was part of my data science summer internship. My team and I were tasked with evaluating multiple machine learning models for ECG data classification. We started doing binary classification between normal and abnormal heartbeats and moved to multi-class classification by labeling abnormal heartbeats with their underlying disease or condition.

- **Technologies Used:** Sci-kit Learn, pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib
- **Outcome:** I learned how to preprocessed and normalized complex datasets to boost model accuracy, employing hyper-parameter tuning and advanced preprocessing techniques for both supervised and unsupervised learning. I learned about various machine learning models for classification such KNN, Neural Networks, Random/Deep Forest, and XGBoost. I collaborated with Ph.D. and Masters students, showcasing our findings through a poster presentation for researchers and staff at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
